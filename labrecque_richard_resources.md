# The following is a list of resources I have found useful in my Mod0
  * [Google](google.com) I'm sure everyone will start with this one, its almost too obvious, dont overlook its power to get you started
  * My single biggest asset has been Turing Alumni, Im lucky enough to know a few from before they attended school, but I also know Turing as a pretty extensive network of other Alumni who are willing to help guide if needed.
  * THE TURING SLACK:  Besides directly asking a question on slack, there is a wealth of existing information, other users questions and answers are searchable there. If im totally stumped I can search around there, and often find a plain english answer of what im looking for, already set up to help a student understand.
